Create a variable for storing the to-do items (e.g. const todoList = []).
Select the HTML elements that you'll need to interact with (e.g. the input field, add button, and list container).
Add an event listener to the add button that triggers when it's clicked.
Inside the event listener, get the value of the input field.
Add the input value to the to-do list variable using the push() method.
Create an HTML element for each item in the to-do list (e.g. li element).
Add the item text as the textContent of the new li element.
Append the new li element to the list container.
Clear the input field by setting its value to an empty string.
Add event listeners to each list item that remove the item from the to-do list when clicked.
Update the HTML by removing the corresponding li element from the list container.
(Optional) Add functionality to edit and mark completed tasks.
